# -Blinkit-Data-Analysis-using-Python
## Project Objective:
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Blinkitâ€™s dataset using Python to uncover insights into sales performance, product categories, and customer behavior.
ðŸ”¹ Key Steps & Skills Applied:

Cleaned and pre-processed raw data using Pandas & NumPy

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

Created visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn for better insights

Applied statistical techniques to analyze sales, item types, outlet sizes, and item visibility

Derived business insights to support decision-making and strategy building

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
The analysis highlighted top-performing product categories, sales trends across outlets, and factors influencing customer purchases. These insights can help optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies for Blinkit.

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
